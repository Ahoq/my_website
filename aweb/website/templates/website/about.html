        <h2>
        My name is Adnan Hoq. I am a senior at St. Joseph's College NY and double<br> majoring in Math & Computer Science. I aspire to be a successful full-stack <br> developer at a renowned tech company. Moreover, I have an acute interest in the<br>  field of machine learning, data visualization, and software testing. I am<br>  an honors student with almost three years of programming experience. Aside <br> from my academic and professional pursuits, I like to indulge in the art of <br> filmmaking. I like to explore my skills and creativity as an amateur <br> screenwriter and editor every now and then. Additionally, I enjoy going to the <br> theaters and watching indie films.
